## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<img width="250" height="300" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/85c2db8a-4b34-43ea-992c-38f8b746c266" />

I am a student from Can Tho University, VietNam. My programming journey started after graduating from high school, when I first came into contact with the world of networking, data and security. I started by learning the basics such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Python, C++, Cisco Packet Tracert and database structure.

Currently, I am a second year student majoring in Computer Networks and Data Communications with a strong passion for technology backbone and problem solving through technology. During my studies, I am deepening my knowledge of programming languages, device configuration, operating systems, etc.

Through this portfolio, I hope to introduce the projects I have participated in as a new programmer. Although my experience is limited, I am committed to constantly learning and growing, and I will continue to strive to improve my skills.

I am also open to collaborating on any project related to NETWORKING OR SECURITY. To contact, please visit below;
